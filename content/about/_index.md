## About This Blog

In this blog, I will write tips for gaming on linux, mainly using [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) [proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton).

This blog is generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in rust.

Theme is originally made by [panr](https://twitter.com/panr) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) named as [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend), and ported to Zola by me.
Ported theme has not been released yet and no plan of release now, but you can see the source code of the theme in the github repo of this blog ([here](https://github.com/MiyacoGBF/mlgb/tree/master/themes/hello-friend)).
This theme supports only Zola v0.12.0 (not released yet, currently on `next` branch) or newer.
